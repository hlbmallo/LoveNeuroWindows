    "Q1A": "A. To decrease the speed of action potentials.",
    "Q1B": "B. To increase the speed of action potentials.",
    "Q1C": "C. To receive neurotransmitters from the synapse.",
    "Q1D": "D. To release neurotransmitters into the synapse.",
    "ANS": "B. To increase the speed of action potentials.",
    "REASON": "Myelin is an insulating material, with gaps between its sections - called nodes of Ranvier. Action potentials jump along the neuron ('saltatory conduction') at these nodes, thereby speeding up action potential transmission."
