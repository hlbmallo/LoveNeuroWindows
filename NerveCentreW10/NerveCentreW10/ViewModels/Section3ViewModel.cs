                Description1 = "Let’s begin by looking at spinal nerves, and defining what they are. A spinal nerve is formed by the sensory and motor neurons that enter and leave the spinal cord. These neurons are part of the somatic nervous system, but neurons from the autonomic nervous system can also travel in spinal nerves (the autonomic nervous system is essentially made up of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions – more on this later). Every spinal nerve is associated with a dermatome and a myotome (see below for more info).<br/><br/>Consider the following example at the vertebral level of T3. There are sensory neurons coming from the upper chest, carrying information like touch, pressure and temperature, and eventually these neurons travel together in a close bundle called the ventral (or anterior) 'ramus'. The nerves coming from the back eventually travel together in the dorsal (or posterior) ramus. These two 'rami' eventually join together and are then called a 'spinal nerve'. The spinal nerve then divides again and the sensory neurons enter the spinal cord via the dorsal root. Processing occurs in the spinal cord/brain. Motor fibres then leave the spinal cord via the ventral root. They also enter the spinal nerve and are then distributed via the dorsal and ventral rami. Sound confusing? Put simply, a spinal nerve is formed shortly after neurons enter/leave the spinal, and a spinal nerve can have sensory, motor and autonomic neurons inside it. Take a look at the Figure 3.1.1 for more info.",

For example, the T3 spinal segment gives rise to two spinal nerves that will provide sensory innervation to a band of skin on the chest and motor innervation to the third intercostal muscles (these muscles that lie in-between the ribs). The spinal nerves might also contain autonomic fibres. It is important to realise that spinal nerves and their branches provide sensory and motor innervation to skin and muscles that are far away. For example, the lumbar and sacral spinal segments will give rise to spinal nerves that provide innervation as far down as the feet.",

                Description3 = "As has already been alluded to, a dermatome is the area of skin supplied by a single spinal segment and its associated spinal nerve. For example, the T10 dermatome extends horizontally around the abdomen, from front-to-back, at the level of the umbilicus. All of the skin in this region, which is about 1 inch in height, conveys its sensory information to the brain via the spinal nerves of the T10 spinal segment.<br/><br/>A myotome is the group of muscles that is innervated by the spinal nerve of a spinal segment. For example, the myotome of the C5 spinal segment/spinal nerve includes the muscles of the upper arm (biceps brachii, shoulder region (deltoid, infraspinatus, supraspinatus) and the forearm (brachioradialis). It’s important to realise that, in this example, although these muscles are part of the C5 myotome, some are also part of the C6 myotome – C5 and C6 together form the musculocutaneous nerve which supplies the muscles of the upper arm.",

If a myotome cannot function at all, the individual will not be able to move their muscles. If a dermatome cannot function properly, the individual will not be able to sense anything from that area.

The cranial nerves are peripheral nerves that largely supply the head and neck with various sensory and motor functions. These nerves have different characteristics; they can be sensory or motor in function, and general or special in nature. Many nerve fibres in the head and neck are autonomic – these regulate the vast number of glands, mucus membranes and smooth muscle fibres that are present there. The nerve fibres emerge directly from the brainstem and generally travel a very short distance to their targets. There are 12 cranial nerves. Their nerve fibre types and functions are listed below and you can see the 12 cranial nerves labelled on the brainstem in Figure 3.2.1.",

This nerve detects light using nerve endings at the front of the retina in the eye. As the nerves on each side travel to the cerebrum, they partially cross (also called 'decussate') at a structure called the optic chiasm. This means that the left side of the cerebrum is responsible for processing the right visual fields, and vice versa.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Oculomotor Nerve</strong></p><p>Contains general motor neurons. This nerve provides motor innervation to four of the six 'extraocular muscles' which move the eyeball in the eye socket, namely inferior rectus, superior rectus, medial rectus and inferior oblique. However, this nerve is also responsible for dilating (sympathetic) and constricting (parasympathetic) the pupil.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Trochlear Nerve</strong></p><p>Contains general motor neurons. This nerve provides motor innervation to one of the six 'extraocular muscles', called the superior oblique muscle.

This nerve carries sensory information from the anterior and lateral sides of the face. The fibres detect pain, temperature, touch and pressure. This nerve also contains special motor neurons – these fibres provide motor control to the muscle of mastication (i.e. the four main muscles involved in chewing, namely, temporalis, masseter, lateral pterygoid and medial pterygoid). These muscles have a special 'visceral' embryological origin.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. Abducent nerve (also called 'abducens')</strong></p><p>Contains general motor neurons. This nerve provides motor innervation to one of the six 'extraocular muscles', called the lateral rectus muscle. This muscle is responsible for turning the eye inwards (also called adduction).</p><p></p><p><strong>7. Facial nerve</strong></p><p>Contains special motor neurons. This nerve provides motor control to the muscles of facial expression (examples include the muscles surrounding the mouth and eye, namely orbicularis oris and orbicularis oculi). These muscles also have a unique 'visceral' embryological origin. This nerve also contains general motor neurons – these provide motor control to the lacrimal (eye) and certain salivary (sublingual and submandibular) glands in the mouth. This nerve also contains special sensory neurons, that receive taste information from the anterior two thirds of the tongue (i.e. the main, flat surface of the tongue that comes into contact with food during chewing).</p><p></p><p><strong>8. Vestibulocochlear nerve</strong></p><p>Contains special sensory neurons. This nerve receives sound information via the cochlea. It also receives balance/position information from the semicircular canals.</p><p></p><p><strong>9. Glossopharyngeal nerve</strong></p><p>Contains special motor neurons. This nerve provides motor innervation to one of the pharyngeal muscles, called stylopharyngeus. It also contains general visceral motor neurons that provide motor control to one of the salivary glands, called the parotid gland. This nerve also contains special sensory neurons – these receive taste information from the posterior third of the tongue (i.e. the part that lies vertically).</p><p></p><p><strong>10. Vagus nerve</strong></p><p>Contains general sensory neurons. This nerve receives sensory information from the thoracic and abdominal organs.

For example, if the patient is asked to stick out their tongue and it flops weakly to the left, there is likely to be a lesion of the left hypoglossal nerve or nucleus in the brainstem. If the patient sticks out their tongue and it is continually contracting (this is called 'spastic paralysis') and deviated to the right, there may be a lesion in the neurons running between the left cerebral cortex and left brainstem.",
